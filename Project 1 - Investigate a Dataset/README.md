# Investigating The TMDb Movie Dataset

In this project, I explored the complex and dynamic factors that influence the film industry by analyzing the **TMDb Movie Dataset**.

The process began with **Exploring the Dataset and Asking Questions**, where I identified key areas of interest and formulated questions I was curious to investigate and find answers to.

Next, I conducted **Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to clean and prepare the data for deeper insights. Using various data cleaning techniques and creating various visualizations, I was able to address the questions I posed and uncover meaningful patterns.

The project concluded with a **Summary of Findings and Discussion of Limitations**, where I highlighted key insights and acknowledged limitations, by suggesting areas for future research.
