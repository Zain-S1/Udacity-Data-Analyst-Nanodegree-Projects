# Investigating the Relationship Between Population Growth and Socioeconomic Development

This project explores the complex relationship between population growth and various aspects of a nation's socioeconomic development from 1991 to 2021. The goal is to examine how a country's population dynamics can impact key indicators across four major categories: Economic Performance, Labor Market, Investment and Capital Formation, and Education.

The analysis begins with **Gathering Multiple Datasets** using a variety of methods to source relevant data.

Proceeded with **Inspecting the Data**, both visually and programmatically, to identify any quality and tidiness issues. 

**Visualizations** followd to answer the research questions and draw meaningful observations from the data.

Concluded the project with **Reflections** on the findings and potential implications.
